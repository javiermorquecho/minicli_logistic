# miniCLI logistics## How run:### Windows:[windows path to php.exe] ./minicli routing [addreses file .txt] [drivers file .txt] #### Example:/cygdrive/c/xampp/php/php.exe ./minicli routing addreses.txt drivers.txt ### Linux:First, We need to covert this file to executable:```chmod +x mincli```After, as in Windows, We execute the file more simple with this format:```./minicli routing [addreses file .txt] [drivers file .txt] ```####Example:```./minicli routing addreses.txt drivers.txt```### Location of data files```/public/data```## Main flowminicli file in root directory, it loads the controller app/Command/TruckController.The logic in controller is, load data and generate an resume structure with estimations in variable ss.At the end, the result are extracted of the ss variable.## Flow in detail1. Minicli is a small framework to create simple command line apps. 2. TruckController loads the data of txt files specified in command line reading the directory public/data:```$this->getStreets & $thisGetNames```3. `$this->getSs` get all scores with a mix of:	* `address, the street of the address and an array of drivers with detail of them and the score using the rules.`	* `address, the street of the address and an array of drivers with detail of them and the score using the rules.`	* `Etceteraâ€¦`4. `$this->getSsTotal` generates the evaluation of all drivers for each address showing the address and the user name and score.5. For revision of the result we can uncomment in file app/Command/TruckController.php line 26. The line is:```$this->getApp()->getPrinter()->display( json_encode( $ss ) );```##Tools### PHPPHP 5.6+.### minicliMiniCLI is a tiny, dependency-free PHP CLI framework we're building together in [dev.to/erikaheidi](dev.to/erikaheidi).
